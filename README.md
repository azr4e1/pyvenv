# pyvenv

This is a little and minimalistic bash script that helps me manage 
my python virtual environments. It is basically a wrapper for 
the python venv modules that allows to create, activate, list
and delete virtual environments in a local working directory.

To install the script, clone the repo and run `install.sh` (no sudo).
After that, source your bashrc and run
    
    pyvenv help

to know how to use the tool.
